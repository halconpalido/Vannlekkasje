## Intro

This Calculator is designed to calculate the volume and cost associated with water leakage over different time periods. It allows users to input the area of the leakage, water pressure, and the cost per cubic meter of water to calculate the total cost of leakage per second, minute, hour, day, and year.

The app is in Norwegian.
